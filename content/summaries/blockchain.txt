01
Divisible
A currency must be divisible so that units of its value can be 
paid to match the value of your purchase
02
Scarce
If the medium of the currency is easily obtainable or 
reproducible, it will have little worth.
03
Durable
Money must not have a property that allows it to decay over 
time.
04
Acceptable
Trusted and accepted by all.

Today’s cryptocurrencies have these features! 
Distributed 
vs 
Centralised
Peer-to-Peer
Cryptocurrency allows two users (sender and recipient) to move 
money in a peer-to-peer way. They can do so without any 
intermediaries like banks or payment systems. If you send money 
through a bank, the record about the transaction will appear in a 
centralized database. Theoretically, somebody can change, delete, 
damage, steal or pass it to authorities.
What is Cryptocurrency?
Cryptocurrency
Cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange, created and 
stored electronically in a blockchain, using encryption 
techniques to create monetary unit and to verify 
transactions.
Principles of Cryptocurrency
Decentralisation
No central banks take control of the 
currency.
Immutability
Nobody can modify or delete a 
transaction after its verification and 
addition to the ledger.
Transparency
All the transactions are available for 
viewing by all the network 
participants.

How Cryptocurrency Works
Goals:
• Direct transaction from one person to another
• Avoid having a central authority
• Zero or low processing fee
• Irreversible transactions
“Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System” 
by Satoshi Nakamoto, 2009. 
Everything 
Began 
Here
Cryptocurrency Wallet
A cryptocurrency wallet is 
required before being able to 
send and receive 
cryptocurrencies.
If you want to receive, store 
or send money, usually you 
need a bank.
But in the digital world, you 
need a cryptocurrency wallet.

M
They store a private key on a device 
like a USB stick. Hardware wallets 
make it possible to easily transact 
while also keeping your money offline 
and away from danger.
Hardware Wallets
They run on an app and can be used 
anywhere including retail stores. They 
are similar to desktop wallets but are 
smaller.
Mobile Wallets
They are only accessible from the 
single computer. They offer one of the 
highest levels of security, but it is 
possible to lose all your funds.
Desktop Wallets
They  are accessible from any 
computing device in any location. 
While they are more convenient to 
access, online wallets store your 
private keys online and are controlled 
by a third party.

Sending and Receiving Cryptocurrency
Enter the wallet address of the recipient and 
choose the amount to send.
Transactions
For sending
You don’t have to do anything except share your 
wallet address with the sender.
For receiving
Blockchain
The Centralised 
System Problem
Single Point of Failure: If the central authority 
goes down, everything stops.
Security Risk: A single target for hackers (data 
breaches).
Lack of Transparency: You often can't see how 
decisions are made or data is handled.
Control: The central party has ultimate control 
over your data/transactions.
Cost: Middlemen often add fees.

What is Blockchain?
Block
Each block contains a group of 
confirmed transactions.
Chain
Every block is cryptographically 
connected to the previous one.
A Blockchain is a distributed 
ledger, where a ledger is 
kept at all participants in the 
network. 
Blockchain – User Perspective
A transaction is made in a 
blockchain network, e.g., 
transfer 1 BTC to Alice.
Make Transaction
Make 
Transaction
The transaction is put into 
a memory pool, waiting to 
be verified.
Memory Pool
The transaction is added 
to the existing blockchain 
as a new block.
Finished
The transaction is 
broadcasted to everyone 
in the network.
Broadcast
The transaction is verified 
and approved by the 
blockchain network.
Approval Process

Approval
Why is Verification Necessary?
Validation is done to ensure that the 
sender really possesses at least the 
amount of money he or she is 
spending.. 
Do you really have the money?
Who does the verification?
How is it done?
Questions:

is beautifully designed. I hope and I believe 
that this Template will your Time.
You can simply impress your audience and 
add a unique zing and appeal to your Reports. 
Weakness
Validation is done to ensure that the 
sender does not spend the same coin 
twice.
Prevent Double-Spending
WHY?
Cryptocurrency Mining
Cryptocurrency Mining
01
Mining
The work made by cryptocurrency miners.
Confirming
Miners take transactions and confirm them.
Adding to the Chain
Once the transaction is confirmed, it is added to the chain, 
as a new block.
02
03
Rewarding
Miners are rewarded for their work.
04
What Miners Do
01
Solving a Complex Mathematical Problem
•
Miners will attempt to solve an equation in order to find x 
(known as a nonce)
•
Using a hash function (SHA-256) 
•
Solving an equation: y = f(x) where x has to be found

How Much is the Reward?
50 BTC
3.125 BTC
In 2009, the reward was 50 BTC per block.
Currently, the reward is around 3.125 BTC per block.
Every few years, after a certain number of blocks 
is solved, the fixed reward is halved, making 
mining less profitable
This mechanism is called halving and invented to 
hold back crypto inflation. The increased difficulty 
of obtaining new coins makes them more scarce 
and valuable.
*Limit of 21 million bitcoins, which will be reached in 2140.
DeFi
What is DeFi?
A new way to carry out financial transactions
Decentralised 
Finance
Blockchain-based form of finance that does 
not rely on any central authority.

NFT
Non-Fungible Token
• Assets that are incapable of mutual substitution.
• They are non-interchangeable.
• Examples: Arts, Degree Certificates

Jack Dorsey’s First Tweet
The CEO and founder Jack Dorsey tweeted the very first tweet after 
setting up Twitter back in 2006. The tweet read, “just setting up my 
twttr.” And later on, he sold this tweet as an NFT for a hefty amount 
of money – $2.9 million!
GameFi
GameFi
• Games that run on blockchain technology, 
which is decentralised.
• Earning through winning or trading items.

Implications
On e-Commerce
Why?
Cryptocurrencies can connect people with the world of 
e-commerce. 
Replace centralised systems and credit card systems.
Simplify shopping process and reduce fees.
https://ecommerceguide.com/ecommerce-statistics/
What is the Holdback?
It is possible that the price 
changes greatly within a short 
period of time, and for no obvious 
reason.
Volatility
Main stream adoption depends on 
how cryptocurrencies are regulated.
Lack of Regulations
Why 
Not?
https://bitcoinexchangeguide.com/cryptocurrency-regulation/
Summary
Cryptocurrency was 
created to get rid of the 
middle authority.
Cryptocurrency works on a 
blockchain.
Cryptocurrency has 
implications on many 
areas: banked, unbanked 
and e-commerce.
Cryptocurrency stills 
needs to be clearly 
regulated before it 
becomes widely accepted.
