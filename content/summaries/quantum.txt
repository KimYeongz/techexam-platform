Quantum Computing
Beyond Bits, Into the Qubits
Let Us Start …
Part 1: The World of Classical Computing
What is a “Computer”?
What is "Computing"? 
Solving 
problems with 
instructions
Calculations, 
data processing, 
logic
From simple 
maths to 
complex AI
The Building Block: The Bit (0 or 1) 
• All computers use bits
• A bit is like a light switch: either ON (1) or 
OFF (0)
• It's a simple, definite state
• Everything digital is built from millions/billions 
of bits
Classical Computers: 
Solving Problems with Bits
• Process information step-by-step (sequentially)
• Very fast at what they do (billions of 
operations/sec)
• Great for most tasks: Browse, word processing, 
gaming
• But hit limits for certain complex problems
The 'Limits' of Classical Computers
• Scale: Problems with too many possibilities to check one-by-
one
• Simulation: Modeling tiny, complex particles (atoms, 
molecules)
• Optimisation: Finding the absolute best solution from infinite 
choices
• Time: Some problems would take longer than the age of the 
universe!
Part 2: Entering the Quantum World
Quantum Mechanics - Oppenheimer (2023)
A New Kind of Computer?
• What if our computational foundation wasn't 
just 0 or 1?
• What if it could be 0, 1, AND both at the same 
time?
• Welcome to Quantum Computing!
The Quantum Bit: The Qubit
• Quantum computers use qubits
• A qubit can be 0, 1, or both at the same time!
• This 'both at the same time' state is called 
Superposition
Analogy: The Dimmer Switch
• Classical Bit: Regular ON/OFF light switch
• Qubit: A dimmer switch
• Can be OFF, ON, or ANY brightness level in 
between!
• Allows for richer, more complex information 
states
More Qubits, More Power
• Classical: 3 bits can represent 8 numbers (000-111)
• Quantum: 3 qubits in superposition can represent 
all 8 numbers simultaneously
• Power grows exponentially (2N)
• Small increase in qubits = HUGE increase in 
potential
The Second Quantum Phenomenon: Entanglement
• Qubits can be linked in a special, deep way.
• Their fates are intertwined, even when separated.
• Measuring one instantly tells you about the other.
• It's a key to how qubits "work together."
Analogy: The Magical Linked Coins
• Imagine two coins flipped in separate, soundproof 
rooms.
• No one can see or communicate between rooms.
• Yet, if one lands Heads, the other always lands Tails.
• They are mysteriously linked, always opposite.
Analogy: The Telepathic Twins
• Imagine twins born far apart
• One sneezes, the other instantly covers their nose
• They're linked, even without communication
• This is a simplified way to think of entanglement
Classical vs. Quantum Computing (Summary)
Classical Computers:
• Building Block: Bit (0 or 1)
• Operation: Sequential (one path at 
a time)
• Best For: Everyday tasks, 
structured data, known algorithms
Quantum Computers:
• Building Block: Qubit (0, 1, or both)
• Operation: Parallel (exploring many 
paths at once)
• Best For: Complex simulations, 
optimization, breaking encryption
Part 3: How Quantum Computers "Compute"
How Do They Actually 'Compute'?
Prepare: Set up qubits in 
superposition/entanglement
1
Operate: Apply 'quantum 
logic' to guide probabilities.
2
Measure: Get the most 
likely answer.

Analogy: Sculpting Probability
• Imagine a landscape of possible answers.
• Quantum operations are like carving valleys into 
this landscape.
• The 'correct answer' becomes the deepest valley.
• When the 'water' (qubit's state) flows, it naturally 
settles there.
Analogy: The Maze Explorer
• Classical: Robot tries paths one-by-one until it 
finds exit.
• Quantum: Robot explores all paths 
simultaneously!
• Quantum operations guide it to the right path.
• The 'best' or 'correct' path becomes most likely.
Classical vs Quantum Computers
Challenges in Building 
Quantum Computers
• Fragile Qubits: Easily disturbed (heat, vibration, 
light)
• Decoherence: Losing 'quantum magic' very quickly
• Error Correction: Very hard to fix tiny quantum 
errors
• Isolation: Need extreme cold (near absolute zero) 
& vacuum
Part 4: Where Quantum Computers Excel 
What Are Quantum Computers 
Good For?
• Not for everyday tasks (email, Browse)
• Excels at specific, hard problems:
• Simulating natural systems (molecules, 
materials)
• Optimisation (finding the best solution)
• Complex search and pattern recognition
Application 1: Materials Science 
& Drug Discovery
• Problem: Simulating molecules is hard for 
classical computers
• Quantum Solution: Model complex molecular 
interactions
• Impact: Designing new drugs (e.g., for cancer), 
superconductors, better batteries
Application 2: Optimisation
• Problem: Finding the absolute best solution from 
many choices
• Quantum Solution: Explore many combinations 
simultaneously
• Impact: Efficient logistics (delivery routes), 
financial modeling, traffic control
Application 3: Cryptography 
(Security)
• Problem: Current encryption methods vulnerable 
to future Quantum Computers
• Quantum Solution: Develop 'Quantum-Safe' 
encryption
• Impact: Protect our data, communications, and 
financial systems
• Also, breaking existing encryption (Shor's 
Algorithm)
Application 4: Artificial 
Intelligence & Machine Learning
• Problem: AI models need vast amounts of data 
processing
• Quantum Solution: Process complex data 
patterns faster
• Impact: Smarter AI, better pattern recognition, 
faster learning
• Example: Enhanced image recognition, drug 
discovery AI
Part 5: Current State & The Future
Are Quantum Computers Here 
Today?
• Yes, but... They are still in early stages
• 'Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum' (NISQ) 
devices
• Still small (few qubits), fragile, error-prone
• Not replacing your laptop anytime soon!
The Road Ahead: Challenges & 
Promise
• Challenges: Building more stable qubits, error 
correction, scaling up
• Promise: Solving previously 'unsolvable' problems
• Timeline: Significant impact likely 10-20+ years 
away
• A 'Quantum Winter' vs. 'Quantum Spring' debate
Your Role in the Quantum Future
• Even non-technical fields will be impacted
• Understanding basics helps you adapt
• Stay curious!
• Consider relevant fields: Physics, Computer 
Science, Engineering, even Ethics/Policy
Key Takeaways
• Classical = bits (0 or 1)
• Quantum = qubits (0, 1, or both) + 
entanglement
• Not just faster, but fundamentally different
• Excels at specific, complex problems
• Early stage, but HUGE potential
